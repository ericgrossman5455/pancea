                <p>I have lived with acute chronic neck pain for years and had tried everything; massages, PT, and ergonomic equipment. Before using Pancea my pain was a level 8 out of a 10. My pain was constantly on my mind and wore down my energy.  Other than the reduction in physical pain, I have noticed that I have more mental capacity for my work and life.</p>

                <p>Pancea has been the only company that I have worked with that understands how to tackle and overcome musculoskeletal issues knowledgeable and effectively. Not only does Pancea understand the importance of evaluating employees individually on a holistic level, but they are also aware of the interconnectivity of mental, physical, and emotional health and how imbalance in one area can lead to a downfall in another. Their personalized tailored approach for our employees helped pinpoint their underlying issues and made sufficient strides in their pain levels; thereby improving their productivity and ultimately lowered our medical expenses. The practice behind Pancea is sound and meets the market need of so many corporate wellness professionals desperately trying to alleviate their own population’s chronic pain.</p>
